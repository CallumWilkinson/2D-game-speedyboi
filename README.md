# 2D-game - Speedyboi

Download speedyboi.zip and run exe to play.
 
The player's goal is to jump on the platforms to get to the campfire. When the player makes contact with the campfire, they progress to the next level where their physics become more and more difficult to handle.

This is the first game that I have made in unity. Through this project I put into practise my previous knowledge of OOP in C Sharp. I started with a small youtube tutorial on how to use the unity editor and some basics on scripting movement. I then wrote all code myself through research and small tutorials here and there.
